## What I Learned from this Project?

This project happened to ba a great opportunity to practice and advance my knowledge and famaliarity with Vue as a framework and Vuex as a state management tool. It also helped me hone my Sass skills, implementing Vue libraries and making sure the app is fully-responsive.
